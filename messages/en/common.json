We recognize that technology is a dominant factor in the future workforce, yet many educational institutions lack access to such resources. Through this program, we bring modern learning management technology to schools that need it most."

        "title": "Program Aims",
        "body1": "Through extensive conversations with teachers and educational professionals, we've identified significant gaps in the digital learning infrastructure available to many schools. Many learning management systems on the market lack a cohesive, intuitive user experience, and schools in underprivileged areas often cannot afford access to modern educational technology.",
        "body2": "Our program addresses these challenges directly. Revenue from our paid institutional subscriptions enables us to provide underprivileged schools with comprehensive access to Studious LMS and related educational tools. This sustainable model allows us to bridge the digital divide while continuously improving our platform for all users."

      "receive": {
        "title": "What You'll Receive",
        "body1": "Schools accepted into the program receive the full Studious platform experience—not a limited or stripped-down version. This includes unlimited student and teacher accounts, all premium features (AI assistant, advanced analytics, real-time collaboration), priority technical support, dedicated onboarding specialists, ongoing training resources, and access to all future updates and improvements.",
        "body2": "Beyond the software itself, we provide comprehensive support to ensure your school can maximize the platform's benefits. Our team will work directly with your administrators and teachers to customize the system for your specific needs, provide hands-on training, and remain available for ongoing assistance throughout your journey."
      },
      "qualifies": {
        "title": "Who Qualifies",
        "body1": "We prioritize schools serving students who would benefit most from improved educational technology. This includes public schools in underserved or economically disadvantaged communities, registered non-profit educational institutions demonstrating financial constraints, schools in developing regions or countries, US Title I schools and their international equivalents, and any educational institution that can demonstrate genuine financial need alongside a commitment to improving student outcomes.",
        "body2": "We evaluate each application individually, considering not just financial metrics but also your school's mission, the population you serve, and your plans for using Studious to enhance education. Our goal is to partner with schools that will truly benefit from and effectively utilize our platform to improve student learning experiences."
      },
      "impact": {
        "title": "Our Vision for Impact",
        "body1": "By providing schools with free access to modern learning management technology, we aim to eliminate one of the key barriers facing educational institutions in underprivileged areas. Our approach goes beyond just software—we're committed to providing comprehensive support including training resources, onboarding assistance, and access to educational tools like e-books and digital stationery materials.",
        "body2": "The School Development Program launches in late November to mid-December 2025, with our first cohort of partner schools. As Studious grows, so does our capacity to support more schools. All revenue generated from our paid institutional subscriptions is reinvested into expanding access for schools in need, creating a sustainable model for educational equity that strengthens over time."
